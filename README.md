# 🖐️ Sign Language Recognition Project

Communication is something most of us take for granted — but for people with hearing or speech impairments, it’s not always that simple. Sign languages are powerful, but they vary across regions and aren’t always understood by everyone. This project aims to **bridge that gap** by using deep learning to recognize sign language in real-time and translate it into text.

## 🌟 What this project does

* Uses a webcam to capture hand gestures and expressions in real-time
* Applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to understand and recognize signs
* Makes the system more user-friendly by following **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** principles
* Helps improve accessibility by turning signs into text instantly

## 🔧 How it works

The system processes live video, cleans up the image (removing noise, adjusting lighting, etc.), and then feeds it into a trained deep learning model. The model has learned patterns of different signs and gestures, so it can identify them and display their meaning.

## 🚀 Why it matters

* Builds a bridge between people who use sign language and those who don’t
* Makes communication smoother and more inclusive
* Has the potential to grow into a mobile or web app that can be used anywhere

## 📌 Next steps

We’re just getting started! Future improvements include:

* Expanding the dataset so the model can learn more signs
* Making it adapt to different sign dialects
* Deploying it on mobile or web for easy access

## 💡 Tech in use

* **Python** for coding
* **Algorithms** like CNN for recognition of different sign
* **OpenCV** for video processing
* **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for deep learning
* **Tkinter** (or web technologies) for the interface
